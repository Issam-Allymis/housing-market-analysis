## **Business Requirements**
As a good friend, you are requested by your friend, who has received an inheritance from a deceased great-grandfather located in Ames, Iowa, to  help in maximising the sales price for the inherited properties.

Although your friend has an excellent understanding of property prices in her own state and residential area, she fears that basing her estimates for property worth on her current knowledge might lead to inaccurate appraisals. What makes a house desirable and valuable where she comes from might not be the same in Ames, Iowa. She found a public dataset with house prices for Ames, Iowa, and will provide you with that.

* 1 - The client is interested in discovering how the house attributes correlate with the sale price. Therefore, the client expects data visualisations of the correlated variables against the sale price to show that.
* 2 - The client is interested in predicting the house sale price from her four inherited houses and any other house in Ames, Iowa.


## Hypothesis and how to validate?

### **Hypotheses:**

- **Hypothesis 1:** The size of the lot (LotArea) positively correlates with the sale price (SalePrice) of a house.

- **Hypothesis 2:** Houses with a larger above-ground living area (GrLivArea) tend to have a higher sale price.
- **Hypothesis 3:** The quality of the kitchen (KitchenQual) positively influences the sale price of a house.
- **Hypothesis 4:** The presence of a masonry veneer (MasVnrArea) increases the sale price of a house.
- **Hypothesis 5:** The year of construction (YearBuilt) affects the sale price of a house, with newer houses commanding higher prices.

### **Validating Hypotheses:**

- **Data Exploration and Visualization:** Explore the relationships between the selected variables and the sale price using visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Train regression models to predict the sale price based on the identified features. Evaluate the models' performance and analyze feature importance.
**Business Requirements:**

- **Requirement 1:** Identify key features that significantly impact house prices to inform pricing strategies.

- **Requirement 2:** Understand the preferences of homebuyers by analyzing the importance of various features in determining the sale price.
- **Requirement 3:** Develop predictive models to estimate house prices accurately, facilitating decision-making for buyers, sellers, and real estate investors.
- **Requirement 4:** Visualize the distribution of house prices and important features to gain insights into market trends and demand.

### **Mapping to Data Visualizations and ML Tasks:**

- **Data Visualizations:**
    - Scatter plots: to visualize the relationships between numerical features and sale price.
    - Histograms: to explore the distributions of numerical variables.
    - Heatmaps: to display correlations between features and identify patterns.
- **ML Tasks:**
    - Regression modeling: to predict sale prices based on relevant features.
    - Feature importance analysis: to determine the most influential factors driving house prices.
These hypotheses and corresponding analyses aim to provide valuable insights into the elements leading house prices, allowing stakeholders to make calculated decisions which is cruical in the real estate market.
